# Design Patterns Assignment

## Overview
This project demonstrates six key design patterns, categorized into three types:
- **Behavioral Design Patterns**: Observer Pattern and Command Pattern
- **Creational Design Patterns**: Singleton Pattern and Factory Pattern
- **Structural Design Patterns**: Decorator Pattern and Adapter Pattern

Each pattern is implemented with intuitive code examples, showcasing how these patterns solve common software design challenges.

## Project Structure
The project contains six Java files organized into three packages: `behavioral`, `creational`, and `structural`.

### Behavioral Patterns
- `ObserverPatternDemo.java`: Demonstrates the Observer pattern using notifiers that respond to changes in task addition.
- `CommandPatternDemo.java`: Demonstrates the Command pattern by encapsulating task operations.

### Creational Patterns
- `SingletonPatternDemo.java`: Implements the Singleton pattern for ensuring a single instance of a database connection.
- `FactoryPatternDemo.java`: Implements the Factory pattern to create different shapes.

### Structural Patterns
- `DecoratorPatternDemo.java`: Demonstrates the Decorator pattern by adding behavior (completing tasks) dynamically.
- `AdapterPatternDemo.java`: Implements the Adapter pattern to adapt a task's interface to another.
